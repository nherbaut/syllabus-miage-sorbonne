IBI/SBI;Cours obligatoire;M2-PRO;0;0;Rebecca;;;Social cohesion and implications;This module aims to validate students' involvement in social and community life, emphasizing active participation in initiatives that promote social cohesion and contribute to the university's educational environment. Students will engage in activities such as participating in the student committee (BDE), tutoring bachelor or master students, representing the program in high schools or universities to recruit new students, and attending forums dedicated to further studies. These activities foster the development of leadership, social responsibility, and interpersonal skills, while reinforcing the university's role within the broader academic and social context.;"To promote students' active engagement in the university community.
To develop leadership and interpersonal skills through social and educational activities.
To encourage students to take part in initiatives that contribute to social cohesion and enhance their sense of responsibility.
To strengthen connections between the university and potential future students through outreach activities.
To foster a culture of collaboration, mutual aid, and collective growth within the university.";;No specific academic prerequisites are required for this module, as it focuses on the student's involvement in extra-curricular activities and social initiatives. However, students must be willing to engage with peers and future students.;;VAL;"The student will be required to actively participate in one or more social or educational activities throughout the semester. This may include involvement in the student associaiton (BDE), tutoring, representing the program in outreach activities, or participating in events related to further studies and recruitment. At the end of the semester, the student must submit a detailed report outlining their involvement.
