SBI;Cours optionnel;M2-INF : Software Factories;30;0;Camille;;;Software factories;"This course explores the principles, methods, and technologies behind Software Product Lines (SPLs), a key paradigm for sustainable software engineering. Software factories—automated environments for producing software variants based on a shared set of assets—represent a strategic approach to industrialize software development, promote systematic reuse, and improve long-term software quality. Through SPLs, organizations can reduce redundancy, ensure consistency across products, and lower maintenance costs.
In the context of sustainable digital systems, SPLs offer a powerful response to the challenges of scalability, adaptability, and resource optimization. Most importantly, they provide a structural foundation to limit and actively manage technical debt—by favoring modularity, standardization, and traceability in software development processes. This course combines theoretical concepts with practical application through modeling, variability management, architecture design, and automated code generation.";By the end of the course, students will understand how -owing to their specific economic model, software product lines contribute to sustainability and efficiency in information systems engineering. They will be able to identify reusable software assets, model product variability using appropriate techniques (e.g., feature modeling, decision modeling), and design modular architectures suitable for automated production environments. Students will also gain the ability to evaluate the impact of reuse strategies on software lifecycle costs, technical debt reduction, and long-term system maintainability.
